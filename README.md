## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for Businesses: Users can enter a search term (like a type of cuisine) and a location to find businesses matching their criteria.

- Sort Results: They can choose how the results are sorted (by best match, highest rated, or most reviewed).

- View Business Listings: Once the search is executed, users can see a list of businesses that match their search criteria, including images, names, addresses, ratings, and review counts.

- Handle Errors: The app handles errors gracefully, displaying an error message if there's an issue with the Yelp API or any other part of the process.

- Loading State: During the search, users see a loading indicator to know that the app is fetching data.

- Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on different screen sizes and devices.

- User-Friendly Interface: Overall, the app provides a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to search for and explore different businesses based on their preferences.

- By breaking down the UI into reusable components, you've embraced a modular approach for scalability and maintainability.
- Integrating dynamic data enriches user experience, while leveraging SCSS for styling adds flexibility and efficiency to your workflow.
- Streamlining the data flow optimizes communication between components, enhancing overall performance.
- Your attention to detail and commitment to best practices set a high standard for web development excellence.
